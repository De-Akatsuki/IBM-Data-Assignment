# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# ### In this Notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# ### OBJECTIVES:
# - Create a Jupyter Notebook with markdown and code cells
# - List examples of languages, libraries and tools used in Data Science
# - Share your Jupyter Notebook publicly on GitHub
# - Evaluate notebooks submitted by your peers using the provided rubric
# - Demonstrate proficiency in Data Science toolkit knowledge

# #### Some of the popular languages that DataScientists use are:
# 
# 1. Python
# 2. Java Script
# 3. R

# #### Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. Pandas
# 2. Numpy
# 3. Matplotlib
# 4. Scikitlearn

# |Data Science Tools|
# |:-: |
# |Google Co-Lab|
# |Jupyter Notebook|
# |IBM Watson|

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# In[4]:


## This is a simple arithemitic expression to multiply then add integers.

(3*4)+5


# In[10]:


## This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.

def minutes_to_hours(minutes):
    
    hours = minutes / 60
    return hours

# Convert 200 minutes to hours
minutes = 200
hours = minutes_to_hours(minutes)
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours.")
